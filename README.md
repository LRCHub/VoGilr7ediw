[00:08.27] I run from the liars, the fuel on the fire
[00:12.30] I know I created myself
[00:16.95] I know I can't fight the sad days and bad nights
[00:20.74] But I never asked for your help
[00:25.05] You got hurt
[00:27.57] No, we don't belong together
[00:31.67] So you took the love from my arms
[00:35.04] Into the arms of yours
[00:39.08] But I don't need a cure for me
[00:45.17] I don't need it
[00:47.38] No, I don't need a cure for me
[00:53.53] I don't need it
[00:55.73] No, I don't need a cure for me
[01:10.73] 
[01:02.08] I don't like the tension, the misapprehensions
[01:06.26] About our nature in love
[01:10.22] The glorious teachers are no use for creatures
[01:14.47] Who knows how to play with the gods
[01:18.62] You got nerves
[01:21.36] But they never show unless they hurt
[01:25.40] So you blamed it all on my love
[01:28.87] The moving heart I got
[01:32.93] But I don't need a cure for me
[01:38.86] I don't need it
[01:41.16] No, I don't need a cure for me
[01:47.11] I don't need it
[01:49.49] No, I don't need a cure for me
[01:55.33] I don't need it
[02:02.83] 
[02:03.72] I don't need it
[02:08.58] Hmm, please, no cure for me, mmm-mmm-mmm
[02:18.32] Please, no cure for me, cure for me
[02:24.84] Cure for me, please, no cure for me, cure for me
[02:33.35] Cure for me, please, no cure for me, cure for me, cure for me
[02:41.73] (And you need to know I don't need it)
[02:45.19] I don't need it (and you should know)
[02:47.49] No, I don't need a cure for me
[02:50.09] (And you need to know I don't need it)
[02:53.16] I don't need it (and you should know)
[02:55.76] No, I don't need a cure for me
[02:58.43] (And you need to know I don't need it)
[03:01.54] I don't need it (and you should know)
[03:04.04] No, I don't need a cure for me
[03:06.92] (And you need to know I don't need it)
[03:10.17] I don't need it (and you should know)
[03:12.38] No, I don't need a cure for me
