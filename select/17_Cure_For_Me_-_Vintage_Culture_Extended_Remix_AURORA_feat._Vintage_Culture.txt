I run from the liars, the fuel on the fire
I know I created myself
I know I can't fight the sad days and bad nights
But I never asked for your help

Hmm, please, no cure for me
Please, no cure for me, cure for me
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na

I don't need it
No, I don't need a cure for
I don't need it
No, I don't need a cure for me

I don't need it
No, I don't need a cure for
I don't need it
No, I don't need a cure for me

Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na

Hmm, please, no cure for me
Please, no cure for me, cure for me
Hmm, please, no cure for me

Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
