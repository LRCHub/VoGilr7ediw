I run from the liars
The fuel on the fire
I know I created myself
I know I can't fight
The sad days and bad nights
But I never asked for your help
You got hurt
No, we don't belong together
So you took the love
from my arms
Into the arms of yours
But I don't need a cure for me
I don't need it
No, I don't need a cure for me
I don't need it
No, I don't need a cure for me
I don't like the tension
The misapprehensions
About our nature in love
The glorious teachers
Are no use for creatures
Who knows how to play
with the gods?
You got nerves
but they never show
Unless they hurt,
so you blamed it all
On my love, the moving
Heart I got
But I don't need a cure for me
I don't need it
No, I don't need a cure for me
I don't need it
No, I don't need a cure for me
I don't need it
I don't need it
Please, no cure for me
Please, no cure for me
Cure for me
Cure for me
Please, no cure for me
Cure for me
Cure for me
Please, no cure for me
Cure for me
Cure for me
(And you need to know
I don't need it)
I don't need it
(And you should know)
I don't need a cure for me
(And you need to know
I don't need it)
I don't need it
(And you should know)
No, I don't need a cure for me
(And you need to know
I don't need it)
I don't need it
(And you should know)
No, I don't need a cure for me
(And you need to know
I don't need it)
I don't need it
(And you should know)
No, I don't need a cure for me
