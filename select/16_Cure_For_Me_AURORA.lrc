[00:09.03] I run from the liars, the fuel on the fire
[00:13.19] I know I created myself
[00:17.78] I know I can't fight the sad days and bad nights
[00:21.57] But I never asked for your help
[00:37.07] 
[00:25.85] You got hurt
[00:28.40] No, we don't belong together
[00:32.63] So you took the love from my arms
[00:36.04] Into the arms of yours
[00:47.04] 
[00:40.07] But I don't need a cure for me
[00:46.09] I don't need it
[00:48.18] No, I don't need a cure for me
[00:54.30] I don't need it
[00:56.59] No, I don't need a cure for me
[01:11.59] 
[01:03.06] I don't like the tension, the misapprehensions
[01:07.04] About our nature in love
[01:11.19] The glorious teachers are no use for creatures
[01:15.39] Who knows how to play with the gods
[01:32.89] 
[01:19.53] You got nerves
[01:22.20] But they never show unless they hurt
[01:26.36] So you blamed it all on my love
[01:29.89] The moving heart I got
[01:40.89] 
[01:33.87] But I don't need a cure for me
[01:39.79] I don't need it
[01:42.04] No, I don't need a cure for me
[01:48.00] I don't need it
[01:50.31] No, I don't need a cure for me
[01:56.29] I don't need it
[02:03.79] 
[02:04.61] I don't need it
[02:12.11] 
[02:09.43] Hmm, please, no cure for me, mmm-mmm-mmm
[02:19.20] Please, no cure for me, cure for me
[02:25.74] Cure for me, please, no cure for me, cure for me
[02:34.26] Cure for me, please, no cure for me, cure for me, cure for me
[03:04.76] 
[02:42.60] (And you need to know I don't need it)
[02:46.42] I don't need it (and you should know)
[02:48.52] No, I don't need a cure for me
[02:51.15] (And you need to know I don't need it)
[02:54.22] I don't need it (and you should know)
[02:56.86] No, I don't need a cure for me
[03:11.86] 
[02:59.40] (And you need to know I don't need it)
[03:02.49] I don't need it (and you should know)
[03:04.95] No, I don't need a cure for me
[03:07.88] (And you need to know I don't need it)
[03:11.09] I don't need it (and you should know)
[03:13.25] No, I don't need a cure for me
